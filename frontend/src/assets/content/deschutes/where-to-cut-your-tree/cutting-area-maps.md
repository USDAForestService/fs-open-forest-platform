Christmas tree harvesters can find pine trees near Bend and Sisters at lower elevations, and fir trees in higher country. Pines around Prineville grow on south and west slopes, whereas firs and cedars typically grow on slopes facing north or east.

When searching for your Christmas tree at the Deschutes National Forest, be sure to use designated motorized roads and to be aware of seasonal road closures.
