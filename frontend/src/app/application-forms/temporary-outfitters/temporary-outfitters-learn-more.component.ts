        <p>Permits and service days are managed by use area.
The maximum allowable <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/special-use/passes-permits/event-commercial/?cid=stelprdb5295777">service days</a>
varies by <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/special-use/passes-permits/event-commercial/?cid=stelprdb5295777">use area</a> and is dependent
on their availability and demand. Only one temporary permit may be obtained per use area every 180 days up to the maximum number of service
days per use area (no more than 200 service days). See the various <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/special-use/passes-permits/event-commercial/?cid=stelprdb5295496">permit pool documents</a>
for descriptions of use areas and the maximum number of service days that may be permitted for each area.</p>

<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/special-use/passes-permits/event-commercial/?cid=stelprdb5295777">pool days</a> with with a maximum of 200 days per permit.
This means you can apply for 1 permit up to 200 days, every 6 months.</li>
          <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Use Area "B" = 150 total pool days, with a maximum of 50 days per permit.
This means you can apply for 1 permit up to 50 days, every 6 months.</li>
          <li><strong>Example 3:</strong> Use Area "A" + "B" = a maximum of 200 days for "A" + a
maximum of 50 days for "B" = a maximum of 250 days for use areas "A" and "B." This means you can apply for days from multiple use areas at the
same time.</li>

        Administration of the temporary permits varies by pool and is specified in the land or river pool permit documents found here</a>.</p>
        <p>Ideally, there would be plenty of service days available to allow all temporary use permits
to be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. However, some permit pools have high demand and are limited in service day capacity.
In this case, we will allocate the permits using a lottery based on due date. Due dates are months ahead of their respective permit period so that applicants who
are granted a permit by means of our lottery will have plenty of time to advertise and prepare. In the event there are unallocated
days left over after the lottery, additional permits may be issued on a first-come,
first-served basis.</p>
