**Background**  
We are in sprint 05 of application development and are continuing to work on the implementation of pay.gov in the permit purchase task flow. While working on completing the task flow, we are continuing to gather data from users about their expectations when purchasing Christmas tree permits. Also, we want to use this opportunity to test our website in general.

**Methods**
* 20 - 30 min usability tests
* Recorded sessions, notes
* Remote meeting (via zoom meeting)

**Participants**
Three people who are not familiar with the Christmas tree Digital Permits project and are participating in the testing sessions for the first time.
One person who is familiar with the project and has participated in previous testing sessions.
