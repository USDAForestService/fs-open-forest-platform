**Background**
We are in sprint 04 of application development, but don't have the entire permit purchase task flow completed. We do however, have a completed initial intake form that we can start to test immediately while the task flow is being completed. Also, we want to use this opportunity to test our website in general.

**Methods**
* 20 - 30 min usability tests
* Recorded sessions, notes
* Remote meeting (via zoom meeting)

**Participants**
4 people unfamiliar with the Chtirstmas tree ePermit application.
1 person who is familiar with the Christmas tree ePermit project and has participated in previous usability sessions.

**Test asset(s)**

Development web server
